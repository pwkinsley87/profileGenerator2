# profileGenerator2

This program is designed for a user who needs to generate a team profile on command. The program utilizes the Node.js CLI and Inquirer, as well as Javascript and of course HTML. All four of the tests are passing, but the app is not fully functional and does not produce a deliverable in the form of a README.md file. I am receiving an error message of "inquirer.prompt is not a function" that tanks the app. I am submitting what I have for now and plan on re-submitting later. Thank you! Here is a link to the app in action:
